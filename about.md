Hi, I’m Samriddhi, I am the writer behind *Unprompted*, the blog you’re reading. 

I am a product and marketing professional, passionate about building mission-driven tech and using digital tools for social good. I currently drive GTM and marketing at CauseCircle, a digital storytelling platform for nonprofits.
I mostly write at the intersection of tech, culture, and impact — but I’m not big on boxes. This space is where I document what I’m learning, what I’m questioning, and what I can’t stop thinking about.

Lately, that’s included AI: how it’s reshaping public narratives, creative labor, and digital inclusion. I have also been very interested in exploring how, in uncertain times, product and communication systems can do more than grow — they can build trust where it’s most fragile.

In a past life, I edited my undergrad college magazine. I’ve been writing ever since — in fits and starts — while working in tech for social impact. Along the way, I co-authored a peer-reviewed paper on how strategic public communications can build trust during COVID-19 (*American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology*) and helped edit a book on English literature in India. Both done in the wild, pre-GPT era, with just Google Docs and grit. For the buttoned-up stuff, those publications are it. This space is for everything else

If you’ve made it this far, we probably have a few thoughts in common. ~[Let’s connect.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samriddhisimlai/)~
I’m also always up for conversations about product, strategy, mission-driven tech, or your favorite coffee shop. ~[Let’s chat.](https://forms.gle/DF5sjgZfZUEDkGwP9)~
