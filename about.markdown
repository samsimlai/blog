Hi, I’m Samriddhi, I am the writer behind *Unprompted*, the blog you’re reading. 

I am a product and marketing professional, passionate about building mission-driven tech and using digital tools for social good. I currently drive GTM and marketing at CauseCircle, a digital storytelling platform for nonprofits.

I mostly write at the intersection of tech, culture, and impact — but I’m not big on boxes. This space is where I want to document what I’m learning, what I’m questioning, or what I can’t stop thinking about.

Lately, that’s included (*yes, surprise*) AI: how it’s expanding accessibility, reframing creative labor, and reshaping public narratives. In a year where headlines feel like plot twists, I’ve also been thinking about how, in uncertain times, product and communication systems can do more than scale — they can earn trust in places it’s most at risk.

In a past life, I edited my undergrad college magazine. I’ve been writing ever since — in fits and starts — while working in mission-driven tech. Along the way, I co-authored a peer-reviewed paper on how digital public communications, when strategically deployed, can build trust during COVID-19 [\(*American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology*\)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9221742/), and helped edit [a book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-10-5332-0) on the role of English studies in shaping digital cultures and postcolonial modern Indian identity. Both done in the wild, pre-GPT era, with just Google Docs and grit. For the buttoned-up stuff, those publications are it. This space is for everything else.

If you’ve made it this far, we probably have a few thoughts in common. [Let’s connect.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samriddhisimlai/)

I’m also always up for conversations about product, strategy, mission-driven tech, or your favorite coffee shop. (Brownie points for your favorite biryani place.) [Let’s chat.](https://forms.gle/DF5sjgZfZUEDkGwP9)
